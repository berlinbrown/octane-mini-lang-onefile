Octane mini is a simple proof of concept stack based programming language built on top of Java.  It is very basic, almost esoteric (in the of BrainF**k).
It was created to use only one source file.  The entire implementation is contained in this file.  Despite only using one file, there are dozens of commons operations available.

A suite of test cases are also provided in a separate class.  The goal of this project is to implement a simple stack based language with as few operations as possible.  
This is a turing complete proof of concept language.
